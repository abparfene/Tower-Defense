readme for CBL

### Installation and Gameplay
	Java is needed for this game to run. Download the zip file, extract it and run the MainLogic.java file. Doing this will open the main game window. To start the game the user must make a path between the red tile and the blue tile using connecting arrows, using mouse clicks. The red and blue tiles should be place only on the border squares. After this setup is completed the user can choose to play it directly or save the created path for ease of use. In this game the player has to fight multiple waves of monsters without dying, using the gold received to build different towers. The scope of the game is to survive all the waves of monsters. The player can add improvements to the map, only in between waves. The gameplay can be pause at any time.


### About the project
	For our CBL project we chose to make a tower defense game, inspired from the game franchise Bloons TD. We made a more bare bones game that only uses a fewer amount of enemies and towers.


### Advanced Topic 1: Git

In our project, we use Git as our version control system to keep track of all our code changes. With Git, we’re able to work collaboratively and make updates without worrying about losing previous work. Whenever we add new features—like creating a new tower type or adjusting the game logic—we commit our changes, creating a timeline of our progress. This also lets us experiment with ideas in separate branches and, when they’re ready, merge them into the main project seamlessly. Git really gives us the flexibility to innovate while keeping our code safe and organized.

### Advanced Topic 2: Advanced OOP

In our Tower Defense game, advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles play a key role in organizing and managing complex game mechanics. Here’s a brief overview of the main OOP concepts we’ve applied:

Inheritance: Common properties and behaviors, like health, movement, and drawing, are shared across different game entities (e.g., towers, enemies, and projectiles) through inheritance. 

Composition: Composition is used to combine different objects, such as having Tower objects contain Projectile instances. This enables complex behaviors by combining simple objects, like towers generating projectiles, without tightly coupling the classes.

These OOP principles help create a flexible, reusable, and maintainable codebase that can be easily extended for new levels, enemy types, or game mechanics in the future.
